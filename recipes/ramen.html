                <li>1 to 1 1/2 pounds (about 4 to 6 cups) leftover cooked chicken wings</li>
                <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken stock</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons mirin rice wine vinegar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
                <li>2 to 4 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 (7.1 ounce) package fresh egg noodles, or 2 packages instant ramen, seasoning packets discarded</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick the meat and skin from the cooked wing bones:</li>
                <p>This is easier if they are still warm, but if they are cold just do your best. Set the meat aside.<br>
                    In the Instant Pot insert, add the skin, bones, chicken stock, and water. Lock the lid, and make sure the pressure release valve is set to seal. Select Cook on Manual/Pressure at high pressure for 30 minutes.</p>
                <li>Release the pressure and remove the bones and skin:</li>
                <p>Release the pressure by using the quick-release valve. Depending on the model of cooker you have, you will do this by nudging the valve open with the handle of a spoon or a button on the pressure cooker. When you do this a large burst of steam will release quickly so keep your fingers clear. Unlock the lid.<br>
                    Use a skimmer or slotted spoon to remove the bones and skin from the stock. Discard the solids. If the broth is especially greasy, skim the fat off with a large metal cooking spoon, but a little grease is fine.</p>
                <li>Finish the stock and cook the eggs:</li>
                <p>Add the soy sauce, mirin, and sugar to the pot.<br>
                    At this stage, you can cook the eggs in one of two ways. I put the whole eggs (shell and all) into the stock. Lock the lid, and make sure the pressure release valve is set to seal. Cook on Manual/Pressure at high pressure for 2 minutes.<br>
                    Alternatively, you can make the jammy eggs on the stove as the stock cooks. Try this method to steam the eggs for 10 minutes.</p>
                <li>Prepare an ice bath:</li>
                <p>As the eggs cook, prepare an ice water bath in a small bowl. When the Instant Pot beeps, release the pressure using the quick-release valve.<br>
                    Use a skimmer or slotted spoon to lift the eggs from the pot. Plunge them into the ice water. (They’ll be a tad greasy, but you’ll be peeling them soon anyway.)</p>
                <li>Add the noodles and meat:</li>
                <p>Add the noodles and reserved meat to the Instant Pot. Leave the lid off, switch to the sauté setting, and cook 2 minutes, or until the noodles are cooked through.<br>
                    As the ramen cooks, peel the eggs. Set aside.</p>
                <li>Adjust the seasonings and serve:</li>
                <p>Taste the broth. It may need more salt or soy sauce, depending on how seasoned your leftover wings were. Season as needed.<br>
                    Divide the broth, meat, and noodles between bowls. Halve the eggs and nestle the halves in the broth; they should warm from the heat of the broth. Garnish with scallions and serve.</p>
